Get the Cash App Cash Card. This debit card is connected to your Cash App balance, and by using it you can get various rewards and instant discounts. You can sign up for the Cash Card directly through the Cash Card tab on your Cash App home screen.[4]


Utilize direct deposits to waive ATM fees. If you get more than $300 per month deposited into your Cash App, you can get free ATM withdrawals at any in-network ATMs.[5] While this may not immediately feel like free money, saving ATM fees keeps more of your money in your pocket.
